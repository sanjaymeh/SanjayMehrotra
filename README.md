Hi Everyone, After a short break off few months last year to broaden my horizons of different areas and to reassess my values and priorities in life. My experience allowed me to appreciate how interconnected our worlds is through modern technology. Even though I have been in software and hardware industry, keeping pace with technology is hard and very fast ( Remember pandemic days...), cloud technology has new ways of doing work. This led me on a path to study and develop contemporary skills in the cloud

I have 20+ years of experience mainly in hardware and system software engineering in compute, network and storage of proprietary hardware. 
5+ years of experience in cloud/IT skills in platform and data engineering with modern tools and technologies. 

I am enhancing cloud/IT skills to facilitate transition to the digital industry, with objective of Azure Cloud Certifications and accomplish subject matter of expertise of Azure Core Infrastructure. 

I am currently looking for a job - on site, hybrid or remote in US. Please reach out to me for specific regions for on-site or hybrid in US.
